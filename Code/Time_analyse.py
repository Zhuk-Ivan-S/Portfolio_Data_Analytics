# Insights :
# 1.Order activity is recorded according to the season (this may be related to holidays,
# promotions, and advantageous offers)
# 2. Most orders are placed in the evening (5:00 PMâ€“11:00 PM), which indicates customer activity after work.
# This can be a key time for targeted promotions and marketing campaigns.
# 3. The average faster delivery time was about 12 days, which is in most
# cases less than the expected time. This indicates good logistics efficiency.
# 4.On average, orders arrive 12 days faster than predicted, which can increase
# customer satisfaction and increase their loyalty. Percentage of delivery efficient - 47.23 %
# 5. The proportion of delays is 6.73 %, meaning the company consistently adheres to
# the stated delivery times. This is a competitive advantage.
# 6. Despite the overall positive picture, it is worth analyzing exceptional cases with long deliveries
# to understand their reasons (geography, product category, seasonal peaks).
